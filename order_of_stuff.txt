0.  Save the configuration file reading until later, after Entities implemented.
1.  Implement the Vec2 class, which you will use for all Components // OK
2.  Implement the basic functionality in the EntityManager class
    Implement the EntityManager's addEntity() and update() functions so
    you can start testing the Game class quickly, Don't worry about the update()
    function which deletes dead entities until later when you get more game mechanics
    working.
3.  Implement basics of the Game class:
        a. Construct a player Entity using the spawnPlayer() function
        b. Implement basic drawing of entities using the Game::sRender() function
        c. Construct some enemies using the spawnEnemy() function
        d. Construct a bullet using the spawnEnemy() function
4.  Implement Player Movement in Game::sUserInput and Game::sMovement // OK
5.  Implement the EntityManager::update() function so it deletes dead entities
6.  Implement the EntityManager::getEntities(tag) functionality
7.  Implement collisions in sCollision and entity.destroy() if it's dead
8.  Implement the rest of game's functionality, including config file reading
